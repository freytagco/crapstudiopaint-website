          Don’t you just hate seeing people making slop wherever you go? Well, with Crap Studio Paint, you can create easy knowing you’re making garbage instead.<br><br>
          Crap Studio Paint’s cutting-edge tools can seamlessly make your life just that little bit more inconvenient, emphasizing a much more immersive and frustrating experience. Every single stroke drawn with our patented PastePencil and GooglyBrush can equate to thousands of prompts and images generated, in both effort and reward.<br><br>
          And best of all? You’ll never grow bored. Every feature in Crap Studio Paint is designed with randomness in mind so that no matter how sure you are that your artwork is finished, there will always be surprises right around the corner. Always keeping you on your feet (or elbows)!

            Ever feel like your trusty little brush tool never has a will of its own? That everyone uses it so much, yet it never expresses its fatigue, its desire to say 'fuck you, I decide what lines I make'?<br><br>
            Don't worry. Crap Studio Paint's GooglyBrush Tool has brought the experience of holding a genuine painting companion on your screen. Mirroring the whims of the human artist, it can collaborate with you via its own line-correction features, and in rare cases, even spring to life and interact with your artwork without any input!<br><br><br><br>
            Disclaimer: GooglyBrush is not responsible for any destruction of digital artworks or designs. Handle it with care and caution.

              One fateful day, artist Jake wanted to make some fanart of his favorite video game character. And so, he booted up his tablet and stylus, and began scribbling away. But a few hours later, oh no! Jake realizes he’s been painting on the sketch layer, all over his references! He had no choice but to redraw everything from scratch. What a tragedy.<br><br>
              With Crap Studio Paint’s PastePencil, you can ensure that you’ll never become like poor little Jake. Using advanced anatomical recognition software, the PastePencil can tell whenever you’re sketching something that could be referenced, and automatically creates a reference for you, exclusively on its own layer so you don’t have to fear drawing over it!

              Do you know why Van Gogh's Sunflowers is so well-known? Well, it's because of how he used a magic eraser to create the distinct and pleated texture of the flowers.<br><br>
              When he was painting it, he didn't like the oil texture so he erased it and replaced it with a watercolor texture. But he didn't like it so he erased it and replaced it with a gouache texture. But he didn't like it so he erased it and ended up ripping his canvas and his eraser. Yeah, the texture is actually from museums just sliding a cloth behind the painting to give it an otherworldly feel. Crap Studio Paint's Real. Eraser replicates these revolutions of perfectionism perfectly by also simulating real eraser physics on your canvas!<br><br>
              Wait, what do you mean you can't erase oil paint because of its thickness?

              In the age of pixels and screens,<br>
              The color sense of artists become less and less keen.<br>
              Mixing art used to put people through the wringer,<br>
              Yet today, 'Alt' 'Multiply' 'Overlay' 'Color Dodge' enable us to give the middle finger.<br><br>
              When mankind has formulized even themselves into seamless machine, all chaos is lost and the equilibrium is broken. But never fear, Crap Studio Paint's 4D Color Wheel is here to reintroduce disorder and entanglement back into your lowly lives. To achieve that on a digital interface, however, it must be able to transcend the sheer limits of numbers and equations to manifest the indominable suffering of what humans call 'RNG'.<br><br>
              If this transcendence overwhelms you by any chance, dear viewer, you can always take respite in the laws of color theory that dictate every color shall recombobulate itself back into white, the beginning of all light, a representation of a return to sanity.<br><br>
              For now.

            Crap Studio Paint should be out within the next year or so. It's intended to be my first college project, so be patient and be open to inevitable bugs and errors across the board.<br><br>
            With release there should also be a video on my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Glittaku">Glittaku</a>, that will introduce the app and showcase its features. From there you should be able to find my other socials, though I'm not very active on those.<br><br>
