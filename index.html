          Don’t you just hate seeing people making slop wherever you go? Well, with Crap Studio Paint, you can create easy knowing you’re making garbage instead.<br><br>
          Crap Studio Paint’s cutting-edge tools can seamlessly make your life just that little bit more inconvenient, emphasizing a much more immersive and frustrating experience. Every single stroke drawn with our patented PastePencil and GooglyBrush can equate to thousands of prompts and images generated, in both effort and reward.<br><br>
          And best of all? You’ll never grow bored. Every feature in Crap Studio Paint is designed with randomness in mind so that no matter how sure you are that your artwork is finished, there will always be surprises right around the corner. Always keeping you on your feet (or elbows)!

        The process also includes
        trusting your stylus

            Ever feel like your trusty little brush tool never has a will of its own? That everyone uses it so much, yet it never expresses its fatigue, its desire to say 'fuck you, I decide what lines I make'?<br><br>
            Don't worry. Crap Studio Paint's GooglyBrush Tool has brought the experience of holding a genuine painting companion on your screen. Mirroring the whims of the human artist, it can collaborate with you via its own line-correction features, and in rare cases, even spring to life and interact with your artwork without any input!<br><br><br><br>
