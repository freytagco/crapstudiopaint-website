This is an introductory website for a future college project I have planned called 'Crap Studio Paint' (NOT AFFILIATED WITH CELSYS). The intention behind making it is to provide a satirical and comedic portrayal of art creation due to the advances of AI.  
As AI makes the process of creating art convenient to the point of being able to create technical masterpieces in a single prompt, the value of creation lies more and more in authentic inconvenience and the painful process of human creation.
